### Patch Changes

- aa9b2bb: Typography as tokens: `type.ts`, generated CSS, and Type Mode in the overlay

  A site's type system now lives in a `type.ts` at the project root, as data —
  font stacks, a closed size scale, and the named styles built from them, with
  breakpoint override blocks spelled exactly as a `motion.ts`'s. The same
  argument as motion tokens, applied to type: a size or a leading is a number
  somebody wants to nudge while looking at the page, so it belongs somewhere it
  can be read, edited and written back.

  - **`typography({...})`** (from `modulato`) plus `typeCss()`, which renders the
    module to `:root` custom properties, one `.type-<name>` utility class per
    style, and a `@media` block per breakpoint override. `@modulato/server`
    **inlines it into every SSR response**, so the first painted glyph is already
    correct — no stylesheet round trip, no flash of the default face.
  - **Type Mode** in the Tweak overlay: a Typography card that edits the whole
    system (breakpoint tabs included), and a _Click text_ toggle that turns the
    page into the control — hover any text for a `Tt` badge naming its style,
    click for a card with the style, the class carrying it, the file:line that
    authored the element, and controls for size, leading and kerning. Size steps
    through the project's scale rather than offering a free pixel slider. Each
    edit picks its target first — the style, or just the clicked class (written
    to `overrides`, emitted as custom properties scoped to the selector, so no
    specificity fight can decide it differently).
  - **The writeback learned `type.ts`**, so the overlay, `modulato tokens` and
    `@modulato/mcp` all reach it through the path a `motion.ts` already used. It
    can now also create a key that isn't in the file yet (a per-selector
    override), and it **matches the file's own indentation** — recast defaults to
    four spaces, which reprinted a two-space file's whole object and turned one
    saved slider into a 150-line diff.
  - **`modulato check`** errors on a `--type-…` variable naming no style or scale
    step (what a rename leaves behind — `var()` falls back silently, so the text
    just renders wrong), and warns when a page stylesheet declares `font-family`
    or `font-size` directly.
  - **`create-modulato`** scaffolds `type.ts`, a numbers-free
    `styles/typography.scss`, and a `/styleguide` page rendering the styles, the
    scale and the color variables from the live values — deletable in one folder.

  Type Mode is also reachable without the panel: a round **Aa** button beside the
  ✦ Tweak launcher arms it in one press, and fills in while it is on. Font stacks
  are shown but not editable in the overlay — a stray character in one silently
  falls the whole site back to Times, and a typeface is a decision made once in
  `type.ts`, next to the webfont link it depends on.

  The overlay is now tabbed — **Motion**, **Typography** and **Colors** — rather
  than one scroll holding all three. Colors is read-only: colors are CSS custom
  properties in a stylesheet, not a token module, so there is nothing to write
  back to; it lists the `:root` palette and copies a `var()` on click.

  **Escape** backs out one step at a time — the type card, then Type Mode, then
  the panel — and blurs a focused panel field before any of that.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- c6d364d: Fix two documented commands that could not work.

  - `claude mcp add modulato -- npx modulato-mcp` — there is no `modulato-mcp`
    package on npm (E404). `modulato-mcp` is the BIN provided by
    **`@modulato/mcp`**, so the command only resolved if that package already
    happened to be installed locally, and failed for exactly the person
    following the docs to set it up. It is now `npx -y @modulato/mcp`.
  - MODULATO.md's header told agents to scaffold a new site with `npx modulato
new`, which requires an existing site and rejects an empty directory. Site
    creation is `npm create modulato@latest <dir>`, which the reference never
    mentioned. Both are now stated, in the header and in the CLI section.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 3a57bca: Widen the `modulato` dependency range to any 0.x (`>=0.1.0 <1.0.0`) so a core
  **minor** release no longer forces these packages to a major version bump. Core
  and the framework packages version together on the 0.x line; the range next needs
  revisiting when core reaches 1.0.
