# Contributing to Modulato

Written for humans and agents alike — Modulato is built LLM-first, and that
includes how it's built. If you're an agent: read this file plus
[docs/MODULATO.md](./docs/MODULATO.md) (the complete API) before changing
anything.

## Setup

```sh
npm i               # workspace install (Node >= 20; >= 24 for portless dev)
npm run dev         # examples/demo with SSR + HMR
npm run check       # TypeScript across demo + server + tweak + site — THE gate
```

## Repo map

- `framework/core` → npm `modulato` — runtime (router, hooks, tokens) + the CLI bin
- `framework/vite` → `@modulato/vite` — routing manifest, dev SSR, prod builds, Vercel output
- `framework/server` → `@modulato/server` — React SSR + server-action runner
- `framework/gsap` → `@modulato/gsap` — `useMotion`, Lenis↔ScrollTrigger sync
- `framework/tweak` → `@modulato/tweak` — dev overlay + AST token writeback
- `framework/content-local`, `framework/mcp`, `framework/create` — adapter, agents, scaffolder
- `examples/demo` — the proving ground. Every framework change must keep it green
  and, when user-facing, be demonstrated in it.
- `docs/MODULATO.md` — the single-file reference. Source of truth for all docs.

## Principles a PR must not break

1. **Published from source.** Packages ship raw TS; Vite is the compiler in
   every consumption path and TS consumers typecheck against `src`. Do not add
   tsup/rollup/dist steps — if a non-Vite surface ever appears, that's a
   design discussion, not a build script.
2. **LLM-first surfaces.** The CLI is non-interactive (args only, no prompts),
   takes `--json` everywhere, scaffolds atomically (a conflict creates
   NOTHING), and errors teach ("X is not a page. Known routes: …"). The MCP
   server and CLI share implementations (`modulato/cli`, `@modulato/tweak/tokens`).
3. **Motion numbers are data.** Tweakable values belong in `motion.ts` token
   modules, resolved via `resolveTokens()` — never hardcoded in animation code.
4. **Strict lifecycles.** Everything animated is created on mount and torn
   down on unmount. Pages stack during transitions; page roots paint opaque
   backgrounds.
5. **A feature isn't done** until: demo shows it, MODULATO.md documents it,
   `npm run check` passes, and it's verified running (browser for anything
   visual — SSR curl + DOM-state checks at minimum).

## Docs have three lives

`docs/MODULATO.md` is copied into two distribution channels:

```sh
npm run sync:docs   # → framework/create/MODULATO.md + docs/site/public/llms-full.txt
```

Run it after ANY docs edit. The copies still only reach users via a
`create-modulato` publish and a modulato.org redeploy — see the release ritual.

## Release ritual

Releases run on [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) +
npm **Trusted Publishing (OIDC)** — there is no `NPM_TOKEN`, and versions are
never hand-edited. The CI is `.github/workflows/publish.yml`; all 8 packages'
trusted-publisher configs on npm point at that filename, so **do not rename
it**. Only public `framework/*` packages publish (`demo`, `modulato-org` are
`private` and skipped automatically).

**As you make a publishable change** — add a changeset in the same commit:

```sh
npm run changeset          # interview: which packages, patch/minor/major, summary
```

This writes `.changeset/<name>.md` (intent to release; nothing publishes yet).
Skip it for changes that don't ship to npm (docs site, demo, internal tooling).
Internal deps cascade automatically: a `modulato` bump carries its dependents
(`content-local`, `gsap`, `mcp`, `server`, `tweak`) via `updateInternalDependencies`.

> **Peer-dep bump behaviour — decide before your first core *minor*.**
> `content-local`, `gsap`, `tweak`, and `server` peer-depend on `modulato`
> (`^0.1.x`). `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange` (in `.changeset/config.json`)
> keeps a core **patch** from touching them. But a core **minor** (`0.1.x →
> 0.2.0`) falls outside `^0.1.x`, so Changesets bumps those four peers — and,
> per peer semantics, bumps them **major → 1.0.0**. That's correct, just abrupt
> for a 0.x framework. If you'd rather core minors stay quiet, widen the plugins'
> peer ranges (e.g. `^0.1.0` → `>=0.1.0`) so minors stay in range. Leave as-is if
> a `1.0.0` on plugins alongside a core minor is fine by you.

**To cut the release (default — fully automated):**

1. Land your changesets on `main`. CI opens/refreshes a **"Version Packages"**
   PR that applies every pending bump + writes changelogs.
2. Merge that PR. CI then publishes each changed package to npm over OIDC,
   tags it, and creates a **GitHub Release** per package.
3. First real run: confirm the OIDC publish authenticated with no token (the
   one thing to eyeball, since npm must be ≥ 11.5.1 on the runner — the
   workflow upgrades it).

**Manual fallback** (local, uses your own `npm login` — OIDC only works in CI):

```sh
npm run changeset:version   # apply bumps + changelogs + refresh lockfile; commit
npm run changeset:publish   # npm publish per changed package + git tags
```

Gotchas: scoped packages under this org have landed PRIVATE despite
`access: public` — fix with `npm access set status=public @modulato/<pkg>`;
stale npm tokens surface as 404 on PUT — `npm logout && npm login`.

**Docs are not part of the npm release** — `npm run sync:docs` after any docs
edit, and the reference only reaches users via a `create-modulato` publish
(add a changeset for it) plus a modulato.org redeploy:
`cd docs/site && VERCEL=1 npx modulato build && vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --scope glauber-house`.

Verify from the registry (`npm view`, `npm pack` spot-checks), not just locally.

## The demo's deploy

`examples/demo` is the Halftone site at **halftone.modulato.org**, Vercel
project `modulato-demo` under the **glauber-house** scope (the scope that owns
`modulato.org` — a subdomain cannot attach from anywhere else).

The demo builds for Vercel on its own: `@modulato/vite` emits
`.vercel/output` (Build Output API v3) whenever `process.env.VERCEL` is set,
which Vercel does during its own builds. So the project needs no special
pipeline — only the right project settings, which live in the dashboard and
are therefore invisible from here:

- **Root Directory** `examples/demo`
- **Include source files outside of the Root Directory** ON — the demo is an
  npm workspace and `"modulato": "*"` only resolves from a root install
- **Framework Preset** Other. "Vite" makes Vercel look for `dist/` and apply
  its own routing, which loses the SSR function
- **Output Directory** blank — `.vercel/output` is auto-detected and wins

`examples/demo/vercel.json` pins the framework and build command so those two
are reviewable in git rather than dashboard-only. The rest is not, so check the
dashboard if a deploy behaves oddly.

**Manual deploy**, which is also the escape hatch:

```sh
cd examples/demo && VERCEL=1 npm run build
vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --scope glauber-house
```

That path ignores the project settings entirely, which is why it kept working
while the settings were wrong. It also needs `.vercel/project.json` present —
that file is gitignored, and without it the CLI names the project after the
FOLDER and silently creates a stray `demo` project. Run `vercel link` first if
the directory is not linked.

Without Git integration the site does not redeploy on push, and nothing says
so: it once served a build 37 days stale while `main` moved on. If the
integration is off, add "redeploy the demo" to the release ritual above.
